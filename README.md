- Python 3.7 or higher
- [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/download/) chess engine installed on your system

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brainmate-chess.git
cd brainmate-chess

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Optional: Install with Lichess API support
pip install -e ".[lichess]"
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Start the interactive CLI
chess-ai

# Or run directly
python -m chess_agent.main
```

### Interactive Commands

Once the CLI is running, you can:

1. **Ask questions about the position**:
   - "What's the best move?"
   - "What's my strategic plan in this position?"
   - "Explain why e4 is good here"
   - "What's the evaluation of this position?"

2. **Change the position**:
   - Type `fen` to enter a new FEN string
   - Type `move e4` to make a move on the board

3. **Exit the program**:
   - Type `quit` to exit

### Example Session

```
Chess AI Assistant
=================
Type 'quit' to exit

Current position (FEN): rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1

Enter a question: What's the best move?

I recommend: Play e4
Reasoning: This move supports our strategy to Develop pieces and control the center by making immediate progress.

Enter a question: What's my strategic plan?

Strategic advice: Develop pieces and control the center
Alternative strategies to consider:
1. Ensure king safety

Enter a question: move e4

rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1

Enter a question: What should black play now?

I recommend: Play e5
Reasoning: This move supports our strategy to Contest the center and develop pieces by making immediate progress.
```

## Project Structure
